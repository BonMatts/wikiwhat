The duo also appeared together in an episode of ''[[Sister, Sister (TV series)|Sister, Sister]]'' with [[Tia Mowry|Tia]] and [[Tamera Mowry]], a few episodes of The Steve Harvey show, and they appeared in a special two-part episode of ''[[Cousin Skeeter]]''. They were also featured in an episode of \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\".\n\nOutside of his ventures with Kenan Thompson, Mitchell provided the voice of a mild-mannered and playful dog named T-Bone in the children's cartoon series ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', alongside [[John Ritter]], from 2000 to 2003.  Additionally, he also made an appearance in the 2004 [[Kanye West]] music video ''[[All Falls Down]]'' as a luggage collecting valet. Mitchell co-hosted ''[[Dance 360]]'' with [[Fredro Starr]]; the show lasted for only one season. In 2005, Mitchell portrayed Manny Sellers in the [[sitcom]] ''[[One on One (TV series)|One on One]]'' with [[Kyla Pratt]], and in 2007 Mitchell starred in [[Black Entertainment Television|BET's]] new series ''[[Take the Cake]]''. Some of his other credits include ''[[Honeydripper (film)|Honeydripper]]'' and ''[[Mystery Men]]''. \n\nIn March 2008 he filmed his writing and producing debut, ''[[Dance Fu]]'' in which he also starred as the lead role.
